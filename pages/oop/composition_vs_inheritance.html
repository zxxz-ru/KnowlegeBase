    <h4>Composition is what type does.</h4>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
      <li>Flexibility. Easier change of behaior through delegation to member types.</li>
      <li>Program to Interface principle. Use of Polymorphism. Like in Strategy Pattern.</li>
      <li>Ability to change behaviour at run time, no need to rebuild.</li>
      <li>More complains with open/close principle of SOLID.</li>
      <li>Quicker instantiation, less load time. Member types can be instantiated in other
      Threads or earlier or cashed.</li>
      <li>More natural and somehow easier to comprehend decomposition.</li>
      <li>None or less unwanted methods.</li>
      <li>No namespace pollution, no shadowed methods.</li>
      <li>No need for instances, can use static methods. Smaler memory load.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Inheritance is more of what type is.</h4>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
      <li>DRY Principle.</li>
      <li>Specification and fine grade subtypes of same family of types.</li>
      <li>Easier architecture, more linear.</li>
      <li>Less latency during execution, method calls are going to same location in memory.</li>
      <li>Can use Polymorphism to group subtypes of one common type, Generic use, like in Java's Collections</li>
