  <h4>Dependency Injection.</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Dependenceis are passed to module, module's behavior depends on whatever passed values are.
        Strategy Pattern, Factory Pattern. Module is controlled by top layer. The key benefit of a
        Dependency Injector is that it removes the dependency that the class has on the concrete implementation.
