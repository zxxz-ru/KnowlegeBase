  <p>Think about Heap, Events Queue, Stack. Message when the job is done in Events Demultiplexer goes to Events Queue,
  when/if Stack is empty function callback goes to execution. While executing messages from Events Queue
  this execution will have it's own Stack. See external links.
  setTimeout is one of functions that introduce another player - WebAPI, which is delaying execution
  of callback function. And is not part of Javascript, functionality is provided by Browser.
  Page is painted apx. 60 times a second.
  setTimeout(cb, 0); will place cb to the end of Event Queue immediately.
  jsetTimeout() and setImmediate() the same functionality, but if setImmediate() and setTimeout are set inside IO
  setImmediate() will be executed first.
  process.nextTick() unshift Event Quieue and keep call stack context. So if it's run inside function it will execute
  as last call in the same function.
